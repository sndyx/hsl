# HSL

HSL (Housing Scripting Language) is a programming language that provides
a near 1:1 mapping of housing actions while also maintaining many optional
abstractions and syntax sugar.

## Developers

This repository is divided into a few major sections.

### HSC (Housing Script Compiler)

The compiler is located in the `compiler` directory. The main entry point
for the compiler is `Driver.kt`. The lexer and parser are both located in
the `com.hsc.compiler.parse` namespace. The resultant AST (defined in
`com.hsc.compiler.ir` along with the `Action` IR) is then lowered through
a series of passes in `com.hsc.lowering.passes`, desugaring and validating
the AST. Finally, the AST is converted to Actions via `ActionTransformer`

#### Compiling

Compile the compiler with gradle: `./gradlew compiler:build`

#### Mason

Mason is located in the `mason` directory. It is an experimental build
 tool for HSC that enables easy management of dependencies and compiler
 options. For dependencies, `git` is executed directly.

### Standard Library

The standard library is located in the `std` directory. It is designed to
be a minimal companion to the built-in functions provided by Housing.
